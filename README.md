# Stair Step Detection and Counting
# Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting and counting steps in images of stairs using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts the number of steps in an image, which can be useful for applications in navigation, accessibility, and robotics.

We implemented four different models and compared their performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as the primary evaluation metric.ElasticNet performed well on the training and test sets.

# Dataset
The dataset consists of images of stairs with labeled step counts. Each image undergoes preprocessing before being fed into the model.

# Data Processing Steps:
Image resizing and normalization

Feature extraction (e.g., edge detection, contour analysis)

Splitting into train, test, and validation sets

# Models Used
We tested four different machine learning models:

ElasticNet üîç ((Best performance on training/Validation and test set )

Random Forest üå≥ (Best performance on training/test but high validation error)

Gradient Boosting üìà

Support Vector Regression (SVR) ü§ñ


The performance was evaluated using MAE, which measures how far the predicted step count is from the actual count.

# Results & Evaluation
Train & Test Performance: ElasticNet had the lowest MAE.

Validation Performance: Lowest MAE among all models

Key Findings:

MAE was chosen over accuracy because step counting is a regression problem, not classification.

Small step count errors are tolerable, making MAE a better metric than MSE (which penalizes large errors too harshly).
